- Add: Add queue+threads for notifications (notificationMode thread:<queue size>:<num threads>) (Issue #1449)
- Add: possibility to limit the maximum number of simultaneous connections, using the CLI option -maxConnections (Issue #1384)
- Add: possibility to use thread pool for incoming connections, using CLI option -reqPoolSize (Issue #1384)
- Fix: safer treatment of database fields lastNotification, expiration and throttling in 
       the 'csub' collection, assuming that the field can be either int or long (it is always written as long)
- Fix: number/bool correct rendering in NGSIv1 compound values
- Fix: ONCHANGE notifications triggered by update context operation are filled avoiding querying entities collection (#881)
- Fix: wrong notification values (duplicated) when triggering update context operations are too close (race condition)
- Fix: A bug in the request reading logic that may cause unexpected Parse Errors or even SIGSEGVs
- Fix: Semaphore releasing bug in unsubscribeContext when subscription ID is the empty string (Issue #1488)
- Add: Built-in Timing/Profiling when using the -reqTimeStat (Issue #1367)
- Add: Simulated/drop notifications mode is now orthogonal to -notificationMode (Issue #1505)
- Hardening: exahustive try/catch (mainly at mongoBackend module) 

The code in this branch is a hacked version not suitable for production. It works as a regular CB as long as the following
conditions be met:

1. No isPattern=false csubs are used
2. Triggering is not used

In order to be fully functional, issues #1475 and #1476 has to be completed.
