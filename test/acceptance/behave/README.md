# Context Broker Acceptance Tests

Folder for acceptance tests of context broker NGSI v2.In this framework we are using Behave-python (http://pythonhosted.org/behave).

## How to Run the Acceptance Tests

#### Prerequisites:

- Python 2.7.x (One way would be SCL - The Software Collections Repository)
- pip installed 1.4.1 or higher (http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/)
- virtualenv installed 1.10.1 or higher (pip install virtualenv) (optional).

Note: We recommend the use of virtualenv, because is an isolated working copy of Python which allows you to work on a specific project without worry of affecting other projects.


#### Requirements to fabric (http://www.fabfile.org/)
Fabric is a Python (2.5-2.7) library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks.
Some requirements are neccesary verify before to install `Fabric` library, mainly to pycripto library (Fabric dependency). 
This libraries will be install into `requirements.txt`
```
     yum install gcc python-devel
```
   

#### Environment preparation:

- If you are going to use a virtual environment (optional):
  * Create a virtual environment somewhere, `virtualenv venv_name` (optional)
  * Activate the virtual environment `source venv_name/bin/activate` (optional)
  * Remember to unset the virtual environment when you're done testing, if it has been previously activated `deactivate` (optional)
- You may need to set `export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true` environment variable in your machine
- Both if you are using a virtual environment or not:
  * Change to the test/acceptance/behave folder of the project.
  * Install the requirements for the acceptance tests in the virtual environment
  * You should add `--upgrade` (if you have a previous installed version of this library)
```
     pip install [--upgrade] -r requirements.txt --allow-all-external
```


#### Folders/Files Structure

    components/:                         folder with several sub-folders with features and steps
        --> common_steps/:               folder with common steps used in several features
              -->  *.py                  files with common steps associated to previous scenarios
        --> functionality/               sub-folder to save all features in each functionality area
              --> environment.py:        may define code to run before and after certain events during your testing. (recommend use generic in root path)
              --> *.feature              files used to define scenarios
              --> steps/                 folder of steps associated to features in the functionality
                   -->  *.py             files with steps associated to previous scenarios
    logs/:                               folder to log (it is created if does not exist)
    results/:                            folder to save junit reports (it is created if does not exist)
    settings/:                           folder to store different configurations (this place is configurable in configuration.json) (optional)
    tools/:                              internal libraries
    behave.ini:                          configuration files for behave are called either ”.behaverc” or “behave.ini”
    logging.ini                          log configuration with several loggers (environment, steps and utils)
    configuration.json:                  initial configuration, before of execution
    environment.py                       (generic environment) may define code to run before and after certain events during your testing
    properties.json.base:                reference file with parameters (properties) used in tests (after is copied to properties.json)
    properties.json:                     initially does not exists. This has parameters necessary to execute the tests (see properties.json.base)
    README.md:                           this file, a brief explication about this framework to test
    requirement.txt:                     external library, necessary install before to execute test (see Test execution section)

   Note:
```
       The “environment.py” file (optional), if present, must be in the same directory that contains the “steps” directory 
       (not in the “steps” directory). We recommend use a generic environment.py and import it in the environment.py 
       file in the same directory that contains the “steps” directory.
```


### Executing Tests:

- Change to the test/acceptance/behave folder of the project if not already on it.
- We recommend to create `settings` folder in  behave root directory if it does not exists and store all configurations to `properties.json` and `configuration.json` files.
    - we can use several configurations, create a file (with ssh commands) to each configuration (this file can to have whatever name and extension), 
      each configuration file is used in the initial configuration (see `BackgroundFeature` in *.feature). This option is valid with `UPDATE_PROPERTIES_JSON` equal to `true`
      each file will be composed of lines with ssh commands, that will be executed.
         Example of configuration file into `PATH_TO_SETTING_FOLDER`:
         ```
            # replace values in configuration.json
            sed -i "s/\"CB_RUNNING_MODE\".*/\"CB_RUNNING_MODE\": \"RPM\"/" configuration.json
            
            # copy properties.json.base to properties.json
            cp -R properties.json.base properties.json
            
            # replace values in properties.py
            sed -i "s/\"CB_HOST\".*/\"CB_HOST\":\"localhost\",/" properties.json
            sed -i "s/\"CB_VERSION\".*/\"CB_VERSION\":\"0.24.0\",/" properties.json
            sed -i "s/\"CB_VERIFY_VERSION\".*/\"CB_VERIFY_VERSION\":\"true\",/" properties.json
            sed -i "s/\"CB_FABRIC_USER\".*/\"CB_FABRIC_USER\":\"username\",/" properties.json
            sed -i "s/\"CB_FABRIC_PASS\".*/\"CB_FABRIC_PASS\":\"password\",/" properties.json
            sed -i "s/\"MONGO_HOST\".*/\"MONGO_HOST\":\"mongo_host\",/" properties.json
            sed -i "s/\"MONGO_VERSION\".*/\"MONGO_VERSION\":\"2.6.10\",/" properties.json
            sed -i "s/\"MONGO_VERIFY_VERSION\".*/\"MONGO_VERIFY_VERSION\":\"true\",/" properties.json
         ```
    - Other option is `UPDATE_PROPERTIES_JSON` equal to `false` but in this case `properties.json` will be create manually from `properties.json.base` in root path (used in Jenkins)     
  The settings folder path could be changed in `PATH_TO_SETTING_FOLDER` in the `configuration.json` file. 
- modify in `configuration.json`:
       * PATH_TO_SETTING_FOLDER: folder where are the different configurations
       * UPDATE_PROPERTIES_JSON: determine whether you are create/update `properties.json` automatically or manually (used to jenkins).
           - true: read external file (the file is mandatory) in `PATH_TO_SETTING_FOLDER` (with ssh commands) and execute these automatically (used to create `properties.json`) 
           - false: it does nothing and the creation of `properties.json` will be by user in jenkins console.
       * CB_RUNNING_MODE: is used to determine how is compiled ContextBroker.
           ContextBroker will be compiled and installed previously by user, `http://fiware-orion.readthedocs.org/en/develop/admin/build_source/index.html`.        
           - RPM: CB is installed as RPM, so service tooling will be used to start and stop
           - CLI: plain CB command line interface will be used to start contextBroker, the contextBroker binary (compiled in DEBUG mode) 
             must be available in the system PATH.   
- `properties.json` (MANDATORY) will be create/update in `root path` automatically from settings folder (see `configuration.json`) or manually.
- Run behave (see available params with the -h option).
```
    Some examples:
       behave component/<path>/example.feature                      -- run only one feature
       behave component/<path>/example.feature -t test              -- run scenarios tagged with "test" in a feature
       behave component/<path>/example.feature -t=-skip             -- run all scenarios except tagged with "skip" in a feature
       behave component/<path>/example.feature -t ~@skip            -- run all scenarios except tagged with "skip" in a feature
```

### Actions pre-defined in Feature Descriptions (Pre and/or Post Actions)

In certain cases, could be useful to define actions before or/and after of the feature or/and each scenario. This help to read all pre or post actions into the feature. 

Recommend append labels defined (`Actions Before the Feature`, `Actions Before each Scenario`, `Actions After each Scenario`,`Actions After the Feature`)
into de feature description, these labels are Optional. And define steps with `Setup:` or `Check:` prefix (must be `:` in the step prefix). See `environment.py` in root path.

Example:
```
Feature: feature name...
  As a behave user
  I would like to execute once several steps in the feature
  So ....

   Actions Before the Feature:
      Setup: update config file
      Setup: start service
      Check: verify if the service is installed successfully
  
   Actions Before each Scenario:
      Setup: reinit the configuration
  
   Actions After each Scenario:
      Setup: delete database

   Actions After the Feature:
       Setup: stop service
```


### Summary of Features and Scenarios

Finally, after each execution is displayed a summary (Optional) with all features executed and its scenarios status. See `environment.py` in root path.
To activate/deactivate this summary, modify `SHOW_SUMMARY` variable (boolean).

Example:
```

### Hints:
  - If we need " char, use \' and it will be replaced (`mappping_quotes` method in `helpers_utils.py` library) (limitation in behave and lettuce).
  - If value is "max length allowed", per example, it is a generated random value with max length allowed and characters allowed.
  - "attr_name", "attr_value", "attr_type", "meta_name", "meta_type" and "meta_value" could be generated with random values.
      The number after "=" is the number of chars
        ex: | attr_name | random=10 |
  - If entities number is "1", the entity id has not suffix, ex: `entity_id=room`
    Else entities number is major than "1" the entities id are value plus a suffix (consecutive), ex:
        `entity_id=room_0, entity_id=room_1, ..., entity_id=room_N`
  - If attribute number is "1", the attribute name has not suffix, ex: `attributes_name=temperature`
    Else attributes number is major than "1" the attributes name are value plus a suffix (consecutive), ex:
        `attributes_name=temperature_0, attributes_name=temperature_1, ..., temperature_N`
  - If would like a wrong query parameter name, use `qp_` prefix   
  - the `-harakiri` option is used to kill contextBroker (must be compiled in DEBUG mode)
  - It is possible to use the same value of the previous request in another request using this string `the same value of the previous request`.
     

### Tags

You can to use multiples tags in each scenario, possibles tags used:

    - happy_path, skip, errors_40x, only_develop, ISSUE_XXX, BUG_XXX, etc

and to filter scenarios by these tags: see Tests execution section.
